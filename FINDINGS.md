## F-001 — Nearest-enemy: brute force → uniform spatial grid (M2)

**Wall hit.** At battle scale the sim must find each unit's nearest enemy. The
naive pass compares every unit against every other of the opposite faction —
O(n²). With ~1–2k units that pass dominates a tick and won't hold as counts grow.

**Measurement.** Criterion bench `nearest_enemy` on the Ubuntu box (release), the
full "nearest enemy for every unit" pass over a deterministic uniform layout in a
2000×2000 world (seed `0xA11CE`), grid cell ≈ one unit per cell:

| N (units) | Naive (brute O(n²)) | Grid (build + query, end-to-end) | Speedup |
|----------:|--------------------:|---------------------------------:|--------:|
| 1000      | 2.156 ms            | 449.8 µs                         | **~4.8×** |
| 2000      | 15.84 ms            | 902.5 µs                         | **~17.6×** |

Naive grows superlinearly (2.16 → 15.84 ms, ~7.3× for 2× units) while the grid
grows ~linearly (449.8 → 902.5 µs, ~2× for 2× units), so the speedup widens with
N — exactly the O(n²) → ~O(n) story.

**Decision.** Replace the brute-force pass with `SpatialGrid` (uniform grid,
ring-expanding query) as the nearest-enemy path (introduced in commit
`020b12a`). Keep `brute_force_nearest_enemy` as the differential oracle: the grid
must return the byte-identical answer (ties broken to smallest index), verified
over 80 seeds and the edge cases.

**Evidence.** The table above (criterion medians on the box). Correctness is
pinned by the differential test `grid_matches_brute_over_many_seeds` (grid ==
brute force over 80 seeds, commit `020b12a`) plus the edge-case tests; the
speedup *mechanism* is pinned deterministically (not just wall-clock) by
`grid_visits_far_fewer_candidates_than_brute` — at N=2000 the grid evaluates
fewer than 1/10 the distances the naive scan does. Reproduce:
`cargo bench --bench nearest_enemy` and `cargo test --lib spatial`.

## F-002 — Group move: N× A* → one flow field (M3)

**Wall hit.** A group move sends many selected units to a *single* destination.
The naive implementation runs one A* search per unit — N independent searches
over the same grid toward the same goal — which is N× redundant work that scales
with the group size on every order.

**Measurement.** Deterministic node-expansion count (nodes popped/settled from
the frontier — the reproducible figure, not wall-clock) on a 48×48 obstacle field
(20% blocked, seed `0xC0FFEE`), goal at the far corner, the group = every
reachable cell as a unit start. Pinned by the L2 test
`group_flow_field_costs_far_less_than_n_times_astar`:

| Group (N units) | N× A* (nodes expanded) | One flow field, BFS (nodes expanded) | Work ratio |
|----------------:|-----------------------:|-------------------------------------:|-----------:|
| 1817            | 581,420                | 1,818                                | **~320×** |

The flow field expands each reachable cell exactly once (1818 ≈ the reachable
cell count), independent of N; N× A* re-expands the shared region N times, so the
gap widens with the group size. Wall-clock corroboration (criterion
`group_move_to_one_dest` on the box, release): N× A* **71.5 ms** vs one flow field
**58.0 µs** — **~1230×** (A* also carries per-node binary-heap overhead the BFS
doesn't, so the time ratio exceeds the node ratio).

**Decision.** A group move to one destination computes **one** flow field
(Dijkstra/BFS from the goal over the grid) that every unit follows via
`FlowField::next`, instead of N separate A* searches (commit `f540191`). A* is kept
for single-unit / distinct-goal pathing and as the reachability oracle: the flow
field must agree with A* on reachability (a non-goal cell has a flow direction iff
A* finds a path from it).

**Evidence.** The table above (deterministic node counts, the primary figure) and
the criterion medians. Correctness/agreement is pinned by
`flow_field_reachability_agrees_with_astar` (flow reachability == A* reachability
over every cell of a sealed-pocket map and a random field) and
`flow_field_next_steps_lead_to_goal` (following `next` reaches the goal in exactly
the field distance over walkable, edge-adjacent cells). Reproduce:
`cargo test --test m3_pathfind` and `cargo bench --bench pathfind`.
